ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher used to encode and decode text by rotating the alphabet by thirteen positions It is a special case of the Caesar cipher where A becomes N B becomes O and so on wrapping around after Z Similarly lowercase letters follow the same rotation so a becomes n and b becomes o This method is symmetric meaning applying ROT13 twice returns the original text ROT13 is not used for serious encryption due to its simplicity but it serves as a quick way to obscure text especially for puzzle hints PGS{ebg_13_qrpbqrq} or online forums to prevent spoilers It is often employed in recreational settings or to provide a lightweight level of text obfuscation
